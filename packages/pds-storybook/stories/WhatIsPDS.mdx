# What is Pure Design System?

**Pure Design System (PDS)** is a revolutionary approach to design systems that generates complete, cohesive design tokens from minimal configuration.

## 🎯 The Problem PDS Solves

Traditional design systems require manually creating hundreds of CSS variables, color shades, spacing scales, and component styles. When you want to change your brand color, you need to update dozens of related values and hope everything still looks good.

## ✨ The PDS Approach

With PDS, you provide just a few key inputs:

```javascript
{
  colors: {
    primary: "#0891b2",
    secondary: "#64748b",
    accent: "#06b6d4"
  },
  typography: {
    baseFontSize: 16,
    fontScale: 1.2
  }
}
```

And PDS automatically generates:
- **9-step color scales** (50-800) for every color
- **Semantic colors** (success, warning, danger, info)
- **Smart surfaces** with auto-contrast
- **Typography scale** with proper hierarchy
- **Spacing system** with consistent rhythm
- **Component styles** that adapt to your theme
- **Dark mode** with intelligent color adjustments
- **Mesh gradients** from your palette
